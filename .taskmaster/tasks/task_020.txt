# Task ID: 20
# Title: Firebase Hosting Deployment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Configure and deploy the application to Firebase Hosting with proper build optimization
# Details:
1. Install Firebase CLI:
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

2. Initialize Firebase Hosting:
```bash
firebase login
firebase init hosting
```

3. Configure build settings in firebase.json:
```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "dist",
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**"
    ],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ],
    "headers": [
      {
        "source": "/**",
        "headers": [
          {
            "key": "Cache-Control",
            "value": "public, max-age=3600"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "source": "**/*.@(js|css)",
        "headers": [
          {
            "key": "Cache-Control",
            "value": "public, max-age=31536000"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

4. Optimize build for production:
   - Enable code splitting
   - Configure environment variables
   - Optimize images and assets
   - Enable gzip compression

5. Create build script in package.json:
```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "vite build",
  "deploy": "npm run build && firebase deploy --only hosting"
}
```

6. Test the production build locally:
```bash
npm run build
npx serve -s dist
```

7. Deploy to Firebase Hosting:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

8. Configure custom domain (if applicable)

# Test Strategy:
1. Test production build locally before deployment
2. Verify all routes work correctly with Firebase Hosting rewrites
3. Test application performance using Lighthouse
4. Verify environment variables are correctly applied
5. Test application on different browsers and devices after deployment
6. Verify authentication flows work in production
7. Check for any console errors in production
8. Measure initial load time and optimize if necessary
